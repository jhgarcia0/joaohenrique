        <p class='fs-5'>
            At the beginning of the first month, I did an HTML and CSS training, creating various UI's. Initially, I used
            the basics of CSS and HTML, then moved on to more intermediate topics like flexbox and more specific tags
            like picture. At the end of the month, I started studying Angular, working on the front-end of the SEMFAZ
            homepage (I will leave a link here once the final product is available to the public).

        </p>
        <p class='fs-5'>
            At the beginning of the second month, I started making some additions to the back-end (using SpringBoot), but
            still focused on Angular, just understanding how the back-end worked (in the MVC architecture). At the end
            of the second month, I started making implementations in the back-end, learning from how others did it and
            doing something similar, as well as some custom implementations.
        </p>
        <p class='fs-5'>
            In the third month, I started using the database, learning how theirs worked (I studied MySQL and they use
            SQL Server). At the end of the third month, I started trying to understand more deeply how the back-end
            worked. Instead of copying, I did it from scratch, using the architecture and style of SEMFAZ. From then on,
            I adapted, learning things that helped me associate problems with their causes, so I could solve problems
            faster and faster.
